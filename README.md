!<cmd>   - run a program (same as 'r' command) - completion for shell works too

Still in development!!!

You can switch to VISUAL mode with `v` from NORMAL mode.
```
m - mark/unmark window
```


Testing
-------
* [Debugging rc.lua on ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/awesome#Debugging_rc.lua)

```
Xephyr :1 -ac -br -noreset -screen 1152x720 & DISPLAY=:1.0 awesome -c ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua.test

$ awmtt start --config=~/.config/awesome/rc.lua.new

```


Want to contribute?
----------------
VimAw is only something like protoype and there is a lot of work. Some of the
TODOs you can find at the end of this document or directly in code.

What is the most important thing at the moment is to create list of shortcuts
and their actions. Test them and optimize the list. After it will be necessary
some code beautification and clarification.

Favoured method of contribution is via pull requests. E-mail patches are
accepted too (seberm[at]seberm[dot]com).

TODOs
-----

- [ ] Support VISUAL mode
- [ ] Which shortcut is the best for returning from insert mode? (MOD4 + ESC | CTRL + MOD1 + [)
- [ ] 'u' - open last closed window/application
- [ ] Control + w - manage current window
- [ ] Use 'm' for maximize or for remembering some client? - example: I have focus on my web browser. I want remember it under register x - I do 'mx'. When I want to run my browser next time... I just do '"x'
- [ ] (Normal mode) Fix problems when running a multi-word command using the "!<cmd>", e.g. "!gnome-terminal" does not work -> error: Failed to execute child process "gnome".
